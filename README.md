## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the **causal impact of the 2014 Medicaid expansion** on personal income using **IPUMS-CPS microdata (2012–2016)**.  
We apply econometric methods including:

- **Naïve OLS**
- **Difference-in-Differences (DID)**
- **Two-Way Fixed Effects DID (TWFE)**
- **Triple Differences (DDD)**

Our analysis identifies heterogenous treatment effects, showing that Medicaid expansion produced **significant income gains for low-income individuals**, even though aggregate effects remain statistically weak.
